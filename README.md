# Figma Perfect Pixels
- I assume the outer layout is 370px wide with a 1px border all around, which makes the total width 372px, because the inner layout itself is 370px width. In Css, I reset all elements using `box-sizing: border-box`, so the width already includes the border, padding, and other.
